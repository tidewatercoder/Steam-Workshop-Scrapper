# Steam-Workshop-Scrapper

- This code searches through a games workshop on steam.
- It can either scan 1 page, multiple, and/or even specific pages.
  - If there is content on pages 5-8 the code allows the user to input that into the program.
- While running a progress bar will be shown for each page.
- The scrapper goes into each separate mod grabbing the link of the mod, description, and title.
- Multiple links can be created and multiple links can be scrapped at once.

How to use it
- This only works on the steam workshop.
- To get the required link go to the steam workshop and search for the desired game you wish to scrap after you reach the desired game, select most popular, most subscribed, or most recent.
- Then scroll all the way to "see all items" and click it, then grab the url and add &actualsort=trend&p= to the end of the url and you will have a url that will work',
  - Ex: https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/browse/appid=107410&browsesort=mostrecent&section=readytouseitems&actualsort=mostrecent&p=
  
Currently working on
- I am currently trying to make an automated process for this.
