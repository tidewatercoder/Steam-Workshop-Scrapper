# Steam-Workshop-Scrapper

- This code searches through a games workshop on steam.
- It can either scan 1 page, multiple, and/or even specific pages.
  - If there is content on pages 5-8 the code allows the user to input that into the program.
- While running a progress bar will be shown for each page.
- The scrapper goes into each separate mod grabbing the link of the mod, description, and title.
- Multiple links can be created and multiple links can be scrapped at once.

Currently working on
- I am currently trying to make an automated process for this.
